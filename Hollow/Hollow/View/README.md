# /View

## Grouping Principle

- The `Other` folder is for extensions, framework integration and custom view modifiers.
- Other folders are for views in structure of the UI, grouped by different modules:
    - `Main` - top interfaces
    - `Login` - login interface
    - `Hollow` - interfaces representing a hollow's content
    - `Account` - interfaces for configuring account
    - `Components` - shared reusable components
