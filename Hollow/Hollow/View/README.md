# /View

## Grouping Principle

- The `Customization` folder is for extensions, framework integration and custom views.

- Other folders are for views in structure of the UI, grouped by different modules:
    - `Login` login interface
    - `Main` top interfaces
    - `Hollow` interfaces representing a hollow content
    - `Account` interfaces for configuring account
